The given dataset consists of data related to ride-sharing service costs, encompassing various
factors that could influence the dynamic pricing model of rides. It includes 1,000 records with
the following key attributes:

 Number_of_Riders: The number of riders participating in the ride.

 Number_of_Drivers: The number of drivers available at the time of booking.

 Location_Category: The category of the location (Urban, Suburban, Rural).

 Customer_Loyalty_Status: The loyalty status of the customer (e.g., Silver, Regular).

 Number_of_Past_Rides: The number of past rides the customer has had.

 Average_Ratings: The average ratings given to the drivers by the customer.

 Time_of_Booking: The time of the day when the booking was made.

 Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicle booked for the ride.

 Expected_Ride_Duration: The expected duration of the ride in minutes.

 Historical_Cost_of_Ride: The cost of the ride, which serves as the target variable for
predictive modeling.


**My task was to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify and select the most
important features for predicting the Historical_Cost_of_Ride.**
